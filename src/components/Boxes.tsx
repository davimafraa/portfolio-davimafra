                    <br/>
                    <p>My name is Davi, I'm 22 years old, I'm graduated as Computer Maintenance and Support Technician, integrated with high school, from Instituto Federal de Minas Gerais  (IFMG), I'm currently pursuing a degree on Computer Engineering at Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica de Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG) and I'm also canalizing most of my time and energy into becoming a better Web Developer.

                    <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The two things I like doing the most is studying and working out: the perfect balance between mind and body. I usually use Youtube to study, and the reason why I consider it a hobbie is because I managed to make it something enjoyable. One of the things I watch the most for entertainment is "HTML, CSS and JavaScript Projects", which is not only fun, but also knowledge. Beyond that, Youtube is full of free and high quality courses, which I don't let slip.</p>

                    <h1>PROFESSIONAL GOALS</h1>
                    <br/>
                    <p>I see Web Development as a great opportunity to start on the technology field and I'm currently looking foward to improve my skills and get an internship. However, my final goal is working with Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning, as I appreciate very much dealing with big amounts of data and using it as a powerful tool to a certain purpose.</p>
